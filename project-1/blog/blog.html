                            <p><strong>My First Project</strong> </p>
                            <p>In this project, my task was to build a portfolio project.
                                It has been an enjoyable experience, containing many challenges
                                as I had to adjust, learn and adapt the code to produce a 
                                finished project.</p>
                            <p>In this process I have been exposed to understand how certain
                                elements act, the implementation of CSS and the fortitude to finish a project.</p>

                            <p>I started to learn coding, as a stepping stone to a new career
                                change. I am interest in pursuing software development as a 
                                career because the industry has such a broad spectrum from web development,
                                to artificial intelligence.</p>
                            <p>I hope with the progression of the Treehouse Tech Degree I 
                                form a solid foundation of understanding programming.</p>
